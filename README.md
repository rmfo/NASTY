# NASTY
Nerf Autonomous Sentry Turret for You

The NASTY project aims at devising an autonomous Raspberry Pi & NERF based sentry gun.
Current bill of materials include:
  - NERF Stryfe Elite
  - Raspberry Pi 3+
  - Raspberry Pi Camera v2.1 with 1m extender
  - 2 Quimat LDX218 servos with their aluminum bracket for the tilt/pan mechanism
  - 5-12v 36w power supply for the servos and NERF
  - 5v 15w power supply for the Raspberry
  - breadboards and cables

A few tips on what not to do:-)
  - don't unplug your raspberry pi during first boot, you'd need to reflash your sd card
  - don't short the power supply, you'd melt your Dupont cable (if you're lucky)
